/**
 * Sample JavaFX applications and example code demonstrating the usage of the
 * org.int4.fx libraries.
 *
 * <p>The classes in this package are small demonstration programs intended to
 * show typical patterns when building UIs with the fluent builder API and the
 * accompanying values/model utilities. They are suitable as documentation,
 * learning examples, and manual testing tools rather than production code.
 *
 * <p>Key sample classes include:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link org.int4.fx.samples.SampleApplication} - a compact booking-style form using JavaFX properties</li>
 *   <li>{@link org.int4.fx.samples.ModelSampleApplication} - similar example using the fx-values model and domain system</li>
 * </ul>
