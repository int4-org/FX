/**
 * Common abstractions and utilities for JavaFX builders.
 * <p>
 * This package provides foundational types for creating fluent, declarative
 * builder patterns for JavaFX objects. It includes base builder classes
 * for various node types, interfaces for builders producing {@link javafx.scene.Node}
 * instances, and event handler abstractions that simplify declarative construction.
 * <p>
 * The types in this package are intended to support consistent, reusable,
 * and composable builder APIs across the framework.
