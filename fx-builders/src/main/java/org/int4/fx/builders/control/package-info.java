/**
 * Fluent builders for JavaFX controls.
 * <p>
 * This package provides builder types for JavaFX {@link javafx.scene.control.Control} subclasses,
 * enabling declarative construction, configuration, and optional model binding.
 * <p>
 * Many builders have abstract base types that mirror the JavaFX control hierarchy,
 * allowing consistent fluent APIs across related controls.
